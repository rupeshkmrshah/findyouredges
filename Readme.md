# FindYourEdges


## How to use

Run `pnpm i` then:

- To build: `pnpm build`
- To run a local server: `pnpm start`

To build this demo with streaming (`renderToStream`) instead of `renderToString` run `USE_STREAMS=1 pnpm build`.
After building, `.vercel/output` will be created which you can deploy via `vc --prebuilt`.

## Architecture

- `util/build.mjs` implements the build process on top of `esbuild` that bundles `src/app` into an Edge Function.
- `util/start.mjs` implements a local server using the `edge-runtime` package that can locally run the build outputs
